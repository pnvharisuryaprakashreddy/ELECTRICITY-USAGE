    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <P>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>E</span>nergy has become the lifeblood of all modern economies. It drives the wheels of economic growth as it is a key factor of production of almost all goods and services, along with capital and labor. In addition, there are existing empirical studies that have further highlighted the contribution of energy in economic growth (see Narayan and Smith (2008), Odhiambo (2009), Wolde-Rufael (2009), among others). Therefore, insufficient supply of energy will affect all aspects of economic and social development. On the other hand, energy use is regarded as the major underlying cause of greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. According to the World Resources Institute, 61.4% of total greenhouse gas emissions come from the energy sector (Sadorsky, 2010). The projections of the Energy Information Agency indicated that energy demand is expected to increase considerably in the coming years as the result of population growth and economic development (EIA, 2007). The bulk of this increase will take place in developing countries where the share of energy consumption will increase from 46% to 58% between 2004 and 2040. Energy consumption in developing countries is projected to grow at 3% per year, while energy demand in industrialized countries will grow at 0.9% per year. The bulk of the increase in the global energy consumption is generated from non-renewable energy, specially oil, coal and gas. These trends do not take into account recent and future energy policies in support of the development of alternative energy. The 21st session of the United Nations Conference of the Parties (COP21) held in Paris in December 2015 is a major milestone in efforts to combat climate change. According to the projections of the International Energy Agency, COP21 pledges provide a boost to lower-carbon fuels and technologies, increasing the share of non-fossil fuels from 19% of the global energy mix today to 25% in 2040 (IEA, 2015). However they do not alter the picture of rising global needs for energy. Energy consumption is expected to grow by one-third to 2040, driven primarily by Asian and African countries. Energy efficiency will play a critical role in limiting world energy demand growth to one-third by 2040. The transition to renewable energy combined with improved energy efficiency could help lower global emissions (IEA, 2015, IRENA, 2015, IRENA and C2E2, 2015).

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of this study is to investigate the key determinants of energy consumption in 12 Sub-Saharan African countries. A growing body of empirical studies has investigated this topic, the energy–GDP nexus being the most widely examined. Results from these studies are however mixed and controversial across countries, data, energy variables and modeling techniques (see Ozturk (2010), Narayan et al. (2010), Omri (2015), for a review). Sub-Saharan Africa is an interesting case study given that air pollution is now becoming a subject of great concern for policy makers and environmentalists given the significant rise in pollutant emissions in recent years. More than 75% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa relies on energy sources which are polluting, and indoor air pollution associated with solid fuels use is responsible for more than 4000 premature deaths per day (IEA, 2006). On the other hand, many Sub-Saharan African countries have been experiencing periodic power shortages for the past two decades and one of the main reasons has been the inability to forecast the rapid growth in energy consumption and to make the required investments. The extent of power shortages has become acute in recent years due to increasing demand from growing population and urbanization. Inadequate provision of modern energy infrastructures and services has long been cited as a major constraint to economic growth and poverty alleviation efforts (World Bank, 1994, United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), 2004). During COP21 Africa has pledged its support for renewables by announcing the launch of the African Renewable Energy Initiative (AREI). The overall goal of AREI is to produce 300 GW of electricity for Africa by 2030 from clean, affordable and appropriate forms of energy. By 2020, it intends to provide 10 GW of new and additional renewable energy capacity, while by 2030, the plan is to mobilize the continent potential to generate 300 GW.

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The choice of Sub-Saharan Africa is also motivated by the fact that very few studies have examined the factors behind changes in energy consumption in the countries of this region. At the econometric level, the study uses the bounds test for cointegration developed by Pesaran et al. (2001). This technique has been widely used in many empirical studies. However, our study is an advance over most of these works because we compute exact critical values specific to our sample size using Monte Carlo simulations. In doing so, we ensure that our inferences regarding cointegration are correct. As countries under investigation show differences in the level of development, population and energy consumption, we conduct a country by country analysis instead of a panel data approach.
        
        The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the theoretical and empirical literature regarding the determinants of energy consumption. Section 3 presents the empirical methodology. Section 4 discusses the empirical results, while Section 5 summarizes the major findings of the study and gives some policy recommendations.
        
        <h2>Why developing countries will consume around 67% of the world’s energy by 2040.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rising energy use for the biggest users is expected to be driven by economic growth -measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP), urbanization, and population growth. For India specifically, energy use growth will be mostly driven by expanding economic output –well above rates in China and the rest of the world. For Africa, energy use growth is expected to be mostly driven by fast growing population and urbanization –fastest rates globally.

However, for China, its current fast-growing energy use will begin to slow down around 2030s due to slower population growth and increasing transition away from energy-intensive industrial sectors towards less-energy intensive manufacturing and service sectors– enabling it generate additional economic activity with lower energy use. This transition will be partly driven by stricter industrial standards in light of serious pollution concerns in China. This gives way for India, other developing Asia and Africa to pick up more heavy industrial production for global consumption by 2030s.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slowest energy use growth for developing countries, however, is expected to come from developing Europe and Eurasia group, especially Russia, largely due to low population and economic growth as well as significant energy efficiency gains.Despite high energy use growth, average energy consumption in many developing countries will remain below levels required for human development. The UN’s Human Development Index (HDI) suggests that increases in energy consumption up to around 100 giga-joule (GJ) per head are associated with substantial increases in human development and well-being, after which the relationship flattens out. Yet, many developing countries will not attain this level by 2040 , notwithstanding fast-growing energy use. For India, for instance, energy use per head only increases marginally by 2040 despite having the fastest growing energy use. For Africa, its fast-growing population is expected to suppress the prosperity of its people, thus energy use per capita only rises by one unit to 20 GJ.

But interestingly, energy use per head in China (at 102 GJ) could meet UN standards for human development by 2040. Perhaps this would classify China as a developed country by 2040. It is important to note that, while China struggles environmental degradation due to the high energy use and pollution of its industries, China’s high energy use has also allowed for faster development, that will potentially transform it to a developed country by 2040. This case of China buttresses the environmental cost, yet value of high energy in driving development.This study provides a model by referring to models proposed by Ubogu (1985), Houthaker
and Taylor (1970), and Iwayemi (1981). </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The electricity demand model can be expressed as
follows:
ln Qit = b0 + b1 ln Yit + b2 ln Pit + b3 ln Qi,t-1 + εit (1)
where;
i = 32 selected developing countries.
t = 1999, 2000, … , 2004.
Qit = electricity consumed in the developing countries, i and at time t, expressed in
billion kilowatt-hours.
Yit = per capita real income in the developing countries (GDP at time t, expressed in
US Dollar/ population at time t).
Pit = price of oil (as an alternative variable).
Qi,t-1 = One period lagged electricity consumption in billion kilowatt hours.
Variables are converted into a natural logarithmic form since log-linear specification is
convenient and it can be estimated directly. The equation is known as auto regression because
one of the explanatory variables consists of lagged value of the dependent variable. The
dependent variable for this paper is the consumption of electric energy in the developing
countries from 1999 to 2004. The independent variables are income per capita, price of oil,
and previous electricity consumption. Higher income is expected to increase electricity
consumption through greater economic activities and purchases of electrical-using
appliances.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher the electricity price is, the less should be the quantity demanded by
consumers; given also that electricity is a normal good. Economic theory suggests that electricity purchases will depend on the price of its substitutes such as natural gas and
distillate fuel oil. Because of the difficulties to get data and information regarding the price of
electricity across from 1990s, ‘price of oil’ is the best solution since electricity price increases
when the price of fuel increases. The electricity energy price depends on the price of oil
respectively. Moreover, current consumer electricity consumption is positively related to
previous year’s consumption also, there will be a positive relationship between the consumer
sector’s current electricity consumption and its previous year’s level of electric energy needs.
This study aims to make maximum use of both the time and cross country dimensions of
available data sets, by using data on an annual basis rate. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data spanning a period of 6 years
from developing countries were collected from various sources. A list of 32 developing
countries was retrieved from American Mathemathical Society (AMS) Website. The period
covered from 1999 to 2004 is acceptable due to data availability of other variables. The data
for this study are obtained from secondary sources such as from various websites. Electricity
consumption in billion kilowatt hours and price of oil in US Dollars per barrel are obtained
from Energy Information Administration (EIA) website, while the GDP per capita is sourced
from World Development Indicators (WDI). </P>
