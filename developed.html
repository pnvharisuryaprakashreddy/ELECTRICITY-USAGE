    <h2>DEVELOPED COUNTRIES</h2>

    <P><h2>Electricity usage in developed countries is generally much higher than in developing countries. This is due to a number of factors, including:</h2>

        <h3>Higher levels of economic development:</h3> Developed countries typically have higher levels of economic development, which leads to increased demand for electricity for manufacturing, commercial, and residential use.
        <h3>Higher standards of living:</h3> People in developed countries generally have higher standards of living, which leads to increased demand for electricity for appliances, electronics, and other amenities.
       <h3> More efficient use of electricity:</h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developed countries tend to have more efficient electricity generation and transmission systems, which means that they can use less electricity to produce the same amount of goods and services.As you can see, the countries with the highest electricity consumption per capita are all located in developed countries. This is not surprising, as these countries tend to have higher levels of economic development, higher standards of living, and more efficient electricity systems.

        It is important to note that electricity consumption is not always a good indicator of a country's level of development. For example, some countries with high electricity consumption, such as Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, are relatively small and have low population densities. This means that their electricity consumption per capita is high, but their overall electricity consumption is relatively low.
        
        Overall, electricity usage in developed countries is a complex issue that is influenced by a number of factors. While higher levels of economic development and higher standards of living generally lead to increased electricity consumption, more efficient electricity systems can help to offset this trend.Introduction
        All countries of the world strive to increase their welfare and economic growth usually within the stable trajectory. World total GDP increases every year and over the past 10 years an increase came up to 30.7% according to the World Bank data. The development of the national economy depends on many different factors and one of the most significant is the volume of consumption of energy resources. Therefore, along with global economic growth, there is a steady overall upward trend in primary energy consumption. At the same time, under the influence of technological factors, the structure of consumption of various energy sources changes and the inter-fuel competition is intensifying . The trend towards greening and decarbonization of the economy is another important modern factor in the transformation of the structure of energy consumption. Thus, there is a need to study the relationship between economic growth, energy consumption and energy efficiency of the economies of the world in the context of new climate trends .

        The restriction on the use of fossil energy sources arises due to the finiteness of such resources, uneven localization among countries of the world, as well as negative impact on the environment, which occurs due to the large emission of greenhouse gasses (mainly carbon dioxide and methane) into the atmosphere during production and combustion . Therefore, it is necessary to look for ways to replace the consumption of fossil energy resources or increase the efficiency of their use in order to maintain economic growth, at the same time minimizing damage to the climate and the environment . These processes could lead to a decrease in energy intensity, which is understood as the ratio of the volume of consumption of energy resources to the volume of gross domestic product .
        
        A number of studies was carried out in respect of the differences in the patterns in the energy consumption between regions and countries. Rahman and Velayutham (2019) studied energy consumption is South Asia taking into account share of the renewable sources . Sharvini et al. (2018) showed that for East and Southeast Asian countries one of the key directions to mitigate negative consequences of changes in energy consumption pattern is to enhance governance processes, as well as increase inter-country cooperation . Kasman and Duman (2014) revealed that there are a number of the causal relationships between economic growth and parameters of energy consumption on the example of the developing countries of Europe . Soytas and Sari (2006) argued that even in the sample of the developed countries of G-7 there are different relations and direction of causality between income and energy consumption .
        
        Tiba et al. (2016) consider the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth to identify additional influencing factors . Gerarden et al. (2015) consider energy efficiency in the context of cost minimization .</P>

        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of authors, such as Gillingham et al. (2009) and Gvozdenac-Urošević (2010), considered the impact of energy efficiency policies. New methods for assessing the country’s energy efficiency were proposed by Ang (2006) in order to analyze this topic . Denisova (2019) paid attention to the energy efficiency of the GDP in the context of the impact on CO2 emissions . Hanley et al. (2006) revealed connection between energy production, consumption and efficiency via general equilibrium analysis . Inglesi-Lotz (2016) applied panel data analysis to show positive connection between energy consumption of renewable sources and economic growth . Hannesson (2009) argued that there is a positive, however not proportional relation between GDP and energy use .
        
        The purpose of the study was to analyze the energy intensity of the countries of the world in terms of long-term development trends. In order to achieve that, we analyzed the relationship between GDP and consumption of primary energy sources in absolute and specific values (per capita) separately for developed and developing countries, as well as for macro-regions (division of countries by geographical feature). Then, the degree of influence of the volumes of GDP and consumed primary energy on the change in energy intensity was studied. The novelty of the study consists in the comprehensive analysis of the parameters of the energy consumption taking into account current energy trends and levels of economic development.
        
        <h2>2. Methods and data</h2>
        The study used a set of mathematical, analytical and econometric tools that allow for a comprehensive analysis of the dependence of GDP and energy consumption with differentiation by country and macro-region.
        
        <h3>The object of the study are groups of countries formed by:</h3>
        
        •
        Geographically—macro regions, such as Asia-Pacific, North America, South and Central America (S. & Cent. America), CIS, Middle East, Africa, Europe according to BP classification;
        
        •
        by level of economic development—countries that are members of the OECD and countries that are not members of the OECD .

        The sample consisted of 77 countries selected on the basis of the availability of published data on the GDP and consumption of primary energy sources over the past 30 years. The information and statistical base of the study is the open source annually published reports “Statistical Review of World Energy” by British Petroleum, data from the World Bank.
        
        The study analyzes the dependence of the level of energy consumption and its impact on economic growth for different groups of countries. For the analysis, a linear regression model is used, which describes the dependence of one variable (the level of GDP) on factors (the level of energy consumption). The coefficient of determination (R2) was used to determine the tightness of the connection. In linear regression models R2 is equal to the square of the correlation coefficient between the factor and the dependent variable. In the general case, R2 is calculated by formula (1).

        To analyze the dynamics of GDP and energy consumption, the process of scaling by population size is important. To do this, a separate model of the dependence of GDP per capita and energy consumption per capita is built, which clearly demonstrates the disproportions between the relative and absolute values of variables and factors. In the study, this impact reflects the per capita energy consumption indicator—the number of tons of standard fuel consumed by one person per year and calculated by formula (2).

        where 
        —per capita energy consumption of country groups; 
        —consumption of primary energy sources by groups of countries, 
        —population of groups of countries.
        
        In the context of energy consumption analysis, it is important to quantify the level of energy efficiency of the GDP for groups of countries. In the general case, the energy efficiency of GDP is understood as the ratio of the volume of GDP in monetary terms to the amount of energy consumed by the country in quantitative terms, which is determined by formula (3):
        (3)
        where 
        —energy efficiency of GDP of groups of countries; 
        —gross domestic product of groups of countries, calculated at purchasing power parity
        
        Particular attention in the study is paid to a comparative analysis of macro regions and groups of countries at different levels of economic development in order to rank them in terms of energy consumption in absolute terms and in terms of per capita.
        
        <h2>3. Results and discussion</h2>
      <h3> Energy consumption per capita by macro regions</h3>
        At present, the global energy balance faces the difficult task of meeting the demand for energy resources and at the same time reducing emissions of greenhouse gasses and pollutants into the atmosphere. Thus, the main directions for the development of the energy sector are increasing the efficiency of using energy carriers and decarbonizing the economy. This has a significant impact on changing the structure of energy consumption and stimulates research in the field of achieving carbon neutrality.
        
        The leading countries in per capita energy consumption are Qatar (16.8 toe/capita), Singapore (14.8 toe/capita), Iceland (14.3 toe/capita), and the United Arab Emirates (11.2 toe/capita). Specific consumption in these countries is more than 10 toe. per capita. There is also a large consumption in countries such as Kuwait (9.9 toe/capita), Canada (8.9 toe/capita), Norway (7.8 toe/capita), Saudi Arabia (7.5 toe/capita), USA (6.9 toe/capita), Oman (6.7 toe/capita).
        
        These countries are characterized by a high endowment with their own reserves and resources of fossil fuels. For example, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Canada and the United States carry out large-scale extraction of primary energy sources and thereby ensure their domestic consumption. However, for such countries as Singapore, South Korea, Belgium, a high level of energy consumption is due to the development of institutional factors and international trade against the background of the relatively small population.

        The main consumers of primary energy in the world are the countries of the Asia-Pacific region, where about 44.8% of world energy consumption or 5921 million toe is concentrated according to 2019 data. Over the past 40 years, the center of growth in the consumption of energy resources has been precisely in the Asia-Pacific countries with rapidly growing economies and populations. Between 1980 and 2018, the share of this region in the global energy consumption structure increased from 17.6% to 43.2%. In the context of this region, China is the undisputed leader in energy consumption—3385 million toe (57.2% in the region), followed by India—808 million toe (13.6%) and Japan—435 million toe (7.3%). The combination of these countries has an impressive population, which also affects the high level of energy consumption, for example, in the transport sector or electricity and heat supply to the population.
        
        On the other hand, given the level of population in the study of per capita energy consumption, there is a change in the ranking of countries. Thus, in terms of energy consumption per capita, Singapore is the leader—14.8 toe/capita, followed by South Korea—5.7 toe/capita and Australia—5.6 toe/capita. And the ratio for China is 2.4 toe/ capita, India—0.6 toe/capita (Table 1).
        
        The next region in terms of energy consumption is North America (21.1% of the world total). Until 1980, it provided the largest increase in energy consumption. However, since the early 2000s, there is a slowdown in the growth of energy consumption in the region, and in some years even decline occurred. So, in 2001–2018 the average annual growth rate of energy consumption was 0.3%. The main consumer of energy sources is the United States—2269 million toe (81.5% of the total of the region).</P>
